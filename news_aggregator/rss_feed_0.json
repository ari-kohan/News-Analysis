        "content": "President-elect Trump joined Elon Musk on Tuesday in Texas to observe the launch of a SpaceX rocket as the two leaders have spent significant time together since Election Day.    Trump was joined by some of his staff and Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (R-S.D.) and Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas). Trump embraced Musk, the founder of SpaceX, upon arriving at the company's Brownsville launch facility.    The president-elect earlier in the day urged Republican senators to \"Show Up and Hold the Line\" against Democratic judicial nominations.    Tuesday marked the sixth test launch of SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket. In its fifth test last month, SpaceX&nbsp;caught a rocket booster&nbsp;on its Texas launchpad&nbsp;as it returned to Earth. Trump regularly invoked that test launch during his campaign rallies in the closing stretch of the presidential election.    Trump and Musk have developed an increasingly close relationship in recent weeks. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of social platform X,\u00a0endorsed Trump\u00a0after a July assassination attempt and donated\u00a0millions of dollars\u00a0to a pro-Trump super PAC that helped with voter turnout efforts.    Since Election Day, Musk has been a near-constant presence at Trump\u2019s side at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. He&nbsp;has joined calls&nbsp;with foreign leaders, attended meetings in Washington with the president-elect and offered input on Cabinet positions.    Musk also publicly weighed in on the ongoing fight over who Trump should pick as&nbsp;Treasury secretary&nbsp;over the weekend.    Trump has expressed fondness for Musk, who was also&nbsp;tapped to co-lead&nbsp;a new government efficiency department alongside entrepreneur and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.    But some Republicans, including those close to Trump\u2019s transition, have suggested the honeymoon phase may not last. They have argued Trump will grow tired of Musk inserting himself into decision-making and grabbing the spotlight, just as he has in the past when officials have outshined him.",

        "content": "Ukraine\u2019s top diplomat warned that the United States cannot afford to look weak in the face of increased threats from the deepening cooperation between Russia, North Korea and Iran, addressing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.    Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha\u200e was in Washington marking 1,000 days of Ukraine\u2019s defensive war against Russia, warning against an \u201cexistential challenge\u201d for Western democracies in confronting lawlessness from regimes in Moscow, Tehran and Pyongyang.&nbsp;    \u201cUnder these circumstances, the United States cannot afford to look weak. Russia, Iran, and North Korea will perceive any sign of weakness as an invitation to directly harm American interests and security,\u201d Sybiha\u200e warned during a hearing of the Helsinki Commission.    The foreign minister\u2019s remarks served as a signal to President-elect Trump, who has pledged to pursue \u201cpeace through strength.\" But Trump\u2019s criticism of U.S. spending on Ukraine has raised anxiety in Kyiv and among Ukraine\u2019s supporters that his push to end the war could involve painful concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0    Sybiha also criticized Putin\u2019s threats of nuclear weapons use as \u201cblackmail,\u201d following President Biden\u2019s decision in recent days to green-light Ukraine using Western-provided missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia.\u00a0    \u201cRight now, we see new attempts by the Kremlin to use nuclear saber-rattling to scare the West. Their updated nuclear doctrine and public rhetoric on the use of nuclear weapons are nothing more than blackmail,\u201d Sybiha said.    \u201cThey have used it many times before when strong decisions were made. We must remain cold-headed, clear-eyed, and not give in to empty fear.\u201d&nbsp;    A number of Trump allies have been highly critical of Biden's decision, saying it risks escalating the war and will make a peace deal harder to achieve. However, Republican lawmakers have been largely supportive of the move.     Trump has talked about using his first days in office to end the war between Russia and Ukraine by bringing Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky together for negotiations, but has provided little details on what a deal might look like.     Zelensky has laid out a \u201cVictory Plan\u201d for Ukraine, with major points including NATO offering an invitation for Ukraine to join, and building up Ukraine\u2019s military defenses to a level to deter any future, renewed Russian aggression.    While Zelensky did not include liberating Ukrainian territory under Russian occupation as a critical part of the victory plan, Sybiha rejected ceding land to Russia in exchange for promises of peace.\u00a0    \u201cWe will not accept any \u2018land for peace\u2019 deals. Such ideas will only mean leaving millions of people in the hands of the aggressor and subject to genocide, torture, and oppression,\u201d he said.    U.S. military, economic and diplomatic support is viewed as essential in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, even with robust European support.\u00a0    But future U.S. support to Ukraine is in flux. While some members of Congress have said they\u2019d like to see another aid package for Ukraine, the Biden administration has so far not sent a request to Capitol Hill.    The U.S. has provided an estimated $90 billion in aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in Feb. 2022, and has about $6 billion in funding to use up before Biden\u2019s term ends in January.     Supplemental aid packages for Ukraine have faced increasing opposition from Republicans, with a package that passed in April delayed for months over partisan bickering, and ultimately drawing opposition from just over half of the House GOP conference.\u00a0    \u201cI don\u2019t have much hope for the continued American support which Ukraine needs,\u201d Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), co-chair of the Helsinki Commission, said at the hearing on Tuesday.&nbsp;",

Martin O\u2019Malley.Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin.Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan. Ben Wikler, chair of Wisconsin Democrats.Chuck Rocha, Democratic strategist. In the House, however, Democratic members voted Tuesday to keep their current leadership in place.&nbsp; Members did not blame Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) for the party\u2019s underwhelming performance on Election Day, as he received overwhelming support to return as House minority leader in the next Congress.&nbsp;Democrats also voted to keep Rep.&nbsp;Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) as Democratic whip, Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) as caucus chair and Rep.&nbsp;Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) as the vice chair. &#8202;'WE LEARNED VERY LITTLE FROM 2016' The big question is where the party goes next after Trump cut deep into the Democratic coalition, winning support from working class voters and racial minorities on his way to a second term.&nbsp; Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who is one of only a handful who tried to challenge President Biden in a 2024 primary that was effectively squashed by party leaders, said Democrats have \u201clearned very little from 2016.\u201d&nbsp; He said Democrats allowed themselves to be consumed by left-wing sloganeering and have become too insular, expelling anyone who doesn't pass ideological purity tests on quixotic social issues, while ignoring voter sentiments on border security for too long.&nbsp;\u201cI believe Democrats have become, in many cases, a party centered on imposition and condemnation instead of invitation,\u201d he told The Nation.&nbsp;And Phillips said Democrats have allowed themselves to be defined by their opposition to Trump, rather than putting out a forward-looking vision that voters find compelling.&nbsp; \u201cCondemnation is a very poor strategy for success in politics. Casting that same shadow on all of those that support him is just an absurd and destructive approach,\"&nbsp;the Minnesota Democrat said.&nbsp; Sen.-elect Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) told Semafor: \u201cI personally think that identity politics needs to go the way of the dodo.\u201d &nbsp;Democrats, Slotkin said, need to draw their language from \u201cthe assembly line\u201d instead of \u201cthe faculty lounge.\u201d&nbsp; Meanwhile, a handful of House Democrats who won tough races in Trump country say the next iteration of the Democratic Party must follow their lead.&nbsp; Among them: Reps. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.), Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.) and Vicente Gonzales (D-Texas).&nbsp; The Hill\u2019s Mike Lillis writes: \u201cAs Democratic leaders conduct an election postmortem, the front-liners are urging colleagues to take a page from their playbook, which features a heavy focus on kitchen-table economics while largely avoiding the culture-war battles that were a drag on the party on Nov. 5.\u201d &#8202;LOOKING BACK ON 2024 Vice President Harris\u2019s campaign finances are drawing increased scrutiny, underscored by payments to groups run by the big-name celebrities that appeared with her in the run-up to Election Day.&nbsp; The Harris campaign blew through more than $1 billion in just more than two months, only to end up about $20 million in debt.&nbsp; Via The Hill\u2019s Caroline Vakil and Julia Manchester: \u201cSome members of the party have questioned the campaign\u2019s tactics, including spending money on production costs associated with celebrity-studded events with Oprah Winfrey, Beyonc\u00e9 and others.\u201d &#8202;MEANWHILE, IN THE SENATE... Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) is refusing to concede to David McCormick, even after media outlets have called the race for the Republican, who traveled to Washington, D.C., for freshman orientation.&nbsp; The race is close enough to trigger an automatic recount, if Casey refuses to concede.&nbsp; The Pennsylvania Supreme Court late Monday rebuked the Democratic officials in the state who said they\u2019d defy the court and count undated and misdated mail ballots. McCormick would still have a significant lead even if those illegal ballots are counted.&nbsp; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said the Democratic election officials must \u201cadhere to this ruling and all the applicable laws governing our elections.\u201d&nbsp;\u201cAny insinuation that our laws can be ignored or do not matter is irresponsible and does damage to faith in our electoral process,\" Shapiro said.&#8202; \ud83d\udca1Perspectives: \u2022 The Hill: What the exit polls say about the 2024 election. \u2022 Vox: Dems got wiped out in 2004.

        "content": "The House Oversight and Accountability Committee grilled Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\u00a0Administrator Deanne Criswell on Tuesday over a since-fired FEMA employee's directive that staff avoid houses with Trump campaign\u00a0signage in the wake of Hurricane Milton and the employees' allegations that she was \"simply following orders.\"    The fired FEMA employee, Marn\u2019i Washington, has alleged she was scapegoated, saying in a Monday interview that she doesn't&nbsp;\"create policy\u201d and denying that she violated the Hatch Act, which restricts political activity by government employees.    \"So firstly, I\u2019m being framed. There\u2019s no violation of the Hatch Act. I was simply following orders,\u201d Washington said in an interview on NewsNation\u2019s \u201cDan Abrams Live.\u201d    \u201cI execute orders. I don\u2019t create policy. I do not reinvent the wheel. My record shows that,\u201d she said later in the interview.    Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asked Criswell during the hearing whether Washington was \u201clying\u201d about the practice being common and whether the FEMA administrator had directly spoken to the 13 other people&nbsp;to&nbsp;whom the orders were texted.    Criswell said she had not directly spoken to them&nbsp;but suggested they would be interviewed as part of an investigation into the incident.    She also reiterated\u00a0in response to questioning from ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) that she had requested an Office of Inspector General investigation into the orders, echoing her\u00a0response\u00a0to Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) in a separate hearing before the House Transportation Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management on Tuesday morning.    The Oversight&nbsp;committee was frequently split along party lines in their lines of questioning for Criswell&nbsp;and the broader themes they tackled&nbsp;within the hearing. Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and Jordan attempted to cast the directive as part of broader disdain for supporters of President-elect Trump, while House Democrats frequently brought up the spread of misinformation surrounding FEMA\u2019s presence and the threat of climate change.&nbsp;    False claims about government funding began circulating online shortly after Hurricane Helene struck Florida, Georgia and North Carolina in September. Then-candidate Trump was among those who shared such claims on social media, including that the government was&nbsp;purposely withholding aid&nbsp;from Republican hurricane victims while FEMA redirected disaster relief funds to migrants. FEMA refuted both claims, as well as other inaccurate information surrounding the agency's storm response.    Government officials, meanwhile,\u00a0warned\u00a0that the spread of inaccurate information was complicating relief efforts.    Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) questioned Criswell on Tuesday\u00a0on the effects of such misinformation, to which the FEMA administrator responded that it \u201cmakes individuals who have perhaps lost everything concerned about whether they should come to us for assistance.\u201d    The panel\u2019s Republicans, meanwhile, pressed Criswell on whether Washington's orders were reflective of any broader official or unofficial agency policy.&nbsp;    Questioned by Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) about whether FEMA would be willing to provide all internal communications involving the fired employee and her former supervisors, Criswell suggested the agency would, saying it \u201calways cooperates\u201d with such requests for information.    On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) said FEMA \u201cdid the right thing\u201d by firing Washington and calling for an investigation, and faulted Washington for saying she was motivated by discomfort in certain areas of the state, saying she should instead have gone through proper channels to address them.    However, Moskowitz blamed deeper issues within FEMA on the size of the bureaucracy within its parent department, the Department of Homeland Security, saying that \u201cthis is not new, this has been going on for a while, it happened during the Trump administration.\u201d    \u201cFEMA can\u2019t make the changes you want them to make, Homeland won\u2019t let them because there\u2019s 30 people around a table,\u201d he added.    Committee members were also split in their assessment of FEMA\u2019s responses to the recent hurricanes.&nbsp;    Raskin singled out the agency as a commendable&nbsp;institution in his opening remarks, pointing to praise from Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Ron DeSantis of Florida for the agency's response to recent storms.    Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), meanwhile,&nbsp;whose district was affected by Hurricane Helene, suggested in her questioning of Criswell that FEMA had not been forthcoming in providing reliable information to affected citizens.    But Frost, whose district was also impacted, said his constituents had had \u201cnothing but praise\u201d for the FEMA response, and pointed to recent reports that Trump himself withheld disaster aid for political purposes.\u00a0    Separate Politico reports from earlier this year alleged Trump\u00a0ignored\u00a0a request for aid from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and had been preparing\u00a0to withhold aid from Orange County, Calif., before he was told he had more voters in the county than the state of Iowa.",

The CMS administrator is a Senate-confirmed position. &nbsp;    \u201cThere may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d Trump said in a statement, referring to the slogan pioneered by Robert F.

        "content": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday rejected the idea that voters delivered an Election Day mandate to Donald Trump and the Republicans, arguing that the GOP\u2019s razor-thin majority in the House means that nothing will get done in Washington without Democratic support.    \u201cDespite the claims of some of my Republican colleagues, who have spent a lot of time over the last two weeks talking about some big, massive mandate \u2014 I\u2019m looking for it,\u201d Jeffries said during a press briefing in the Capitol.    The comments were a shot at the Republicans who, after winning control of the House, Senate and White House in the next Congress, have asserted broad powers to pursue a starkly conservative policy agenda.     That includes Trump, who used his victory speech on election night to claim \u201can unprecedented and powerful mandate,\u201d and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who argued Tuesday that voters gave Trump the authority to seat his preferred Cabinet picks \u2014 regardless of any controversy swirling around them.&nbsp;    \u201cPresident Trump is looking for persons who will shake up the status quo, and we got a mandate in this election cycle to do that,\u201d Johnson told reporters in the Capitol. \u201cThe status quo is not working for the American people. And so these are persons who will go in and bring real reform \u2014 significant reform \u2014 to the agencies that they lead.\u201d&nbsp;    Jeffries, who was elected on Tuesday to lead House Democrats again in the next Congress, is vowing to work with the incoming administration on areas of shared interest, while also promising a fight if Republicans seek to slash the Democrats\u2019 sacred cows, including abortion rights and benefits under Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and ObamaCare.    \u201cWe will push back against far-right extremism whenever necessary,\u201d Jeffries said.    House Democrats will likely have some leverage in those coming policy fights. While Republicans will control all levers of power in Washington next year, GOP leaders have struggled repeatedly to unite their feuding troops to pass even the most fundamental bills, like funding the federal government.&nbsp;    Those difficulties are expected to continue in the next Congress, even with an ally in the White House, as GOP leaders seek to move Trump\u2019s ambitious \u2014 and costly \u2014 legislative agenda in the face of expected resistance from conservative deficit hawks. While Republicans kept House control in this month\u2019s elections, their majority will be razor thin, just as it was throughout the current Congress. And the Senate filibuster ensures that Democrats, while relegated to the minority in the next Congress, will also maintain significant influence over most bills that move through the upper chamber.&nbsp;    That combination, Jeffries said Tuesday, means Democrats will have plenty of legislative sway in the next Congress \u2014 and belies the GOP\u2019s claims to a mandate.&nbsp;    \u201cThe question about this notion of some mandate to make massive far-right extreme policy changes \u2014 it doesn\u2019t exist. It doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Jeffries said.&nbsp;    \u201cAnd so in the new Congress, for anything to happen \u2014 particularly as it relates to an enlightened spending agreement, or ensuring that America does not default on our debt and crash the economy and hurt everyday Americans for the first time in our nation\u2019s history \u2014 it\u2019s clear House Republicans cannot do it on their own.\u201d",

        "content": "Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) plans to file legislation that would prohibit trans women from using women\u2019s restrooms and changing rooms in all federal buildings, going further than a resolution Monday to bar transgender&nbsp;women from Capitol facilities.    \u201cI\u2019m working on legislation that would ban it on federal property,\u201d Mace told reporters Tuesday morning. The bill would also apply to schools, she said.    \u201cIf you are a school that is funded by the federal government, this shouldn\u2019t go on,\u201d Mace told reporters.    Asked about the details of her proposal, Mace said she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d&nbsp;going to expand her initial resolution, which aims to prohibit members, officers and employees of the House from using single-sex facilities that correspond to their gender identity. \u201cWait till you see what I file next,\u201d she said.    Mace\u2019s new bill could run afoul of the Biden administration\u2019s latest changes to Title IX, the federal civil rights law preventing sex discrimination in schools and education programs that receive government funding. The administration\u2019s new rule, which the Education Department finalized in April,&nbsp;forbids policies that categorically ban transgender students from school bathrooms that align with their gender identity.    Federal judges have blocked the changes, which do not apply to athletics, in at least 26 states, and the Supreme Court in August denied the Biden administration\u2019s request to partially reinstate the new rule.    President-elect Trump has promised to roll back the&nbsp;latest interpretation of Title IX \u201con day one\u201d of his presidency, though fully reversing and replacing the Biden administration\u2019s changes could take several years.    \u201cThe only thing that violates Title IX are men being in women\u2019s spaces,\u201d Mace said Tuesday, \u201cand I\u2019m going to put a f---ing stop to this bull---- and this insanity.\u201d    Mace\u2019s original resolution, which she filed late Monday, comes just a week after Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.) made history as the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.    The measure charges the House sergeant-at-arms, William McFarland, with enforcing the ban, but it is unclear how the House\u2019s chief law enforcement officer will determine who can and cannot use the Capitol\u2019s facilities.&nbsp;    State laws that bar trans people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity often rely on anonymous complaints, a notoriously unreliable enforcement mechanism. LGBTQ rights activists in May&nbsp;flooded a tip line&nbsp;designed to alert officials in Utah to possible violations of the state\u2019s bathroom ban with thousands of false complaints.    In a statement, McBride brushed off Mace\u2019s resolution as a distraction and accused&nbsp;far-right Republicans of \u201cmanufacturing culture wars.\u201d    \u201cDelawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on,\u201d she said.    \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since Nancy Mace had her 15 minutes of fame,\u201d said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, which&nbsp;promotes LGBTQ equality in the House. The resolution, he said, \u201cis a pathetic, attention-seeking attempt to grab Trump\u2019s eye and the media spotlight \u2014 and trans people, including trans employees, are paying the price.\u201d    House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has sought to ban gender-affirming care for minors and prohibit transgender student-athletes from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, on Tuesday declined to weigh in on Mace\u2019s resolution.    \u201cWe\u2019ll provide appropriate accommodation for every member of Congress,\u201d he said.    Later on Tuesday, Johnson said he believes \u201ca man is a man, and a woman is a woman.\u201d    \u201cBut I also believe we treat everybody with dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do and believe all those things at the same time.\u201d    Mace has rejected assertions from some Democrats and LGBTQ rights groups that her resolution discriminates against LGBTQ people. She told reporters that she broadly supports the community, twice voting to codify same-sex marriage protections.    \u201cBut I have a big fat red line when it comes to men and women\u2019s private spaces,\u201d she told the Washington Post on Tuesday.    Mace\u2019s resolution and forthcoming proposal come amid Democratic infighting over the role the party\u2019s broad support for transgender rights played in its failure to capture the presidency and either chamber of Congress.    Trump and Republicans bet big on anti-transgender messaging in the final stretch of the election, pouring millions into ads that painted their Democratic opponents as extreme and out of touch with most Americans for supporting trans-inclusive policies.    Just 4 percent of voters said opposition to transgender athletes and surgeries drove their vote in this year\u2019s election, according to exit polling&nbsp;released by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy group.

Pressure is mounting on the committee, with lawmakers asking for more information to be made public before they vote on his nomination.

Earlier Tuesday, a hacker gained access to witness testimony related to investigations into Gaetz. An unidentified person downloaded information on Monday afternoon, and the file included 24 exhibits and is reported to include testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old.",

Grassley said some of his GOP colleagues \u201chave some questions\u201d about Gaetz\u2019s fitness to serve as the nation\u2019s next attorney general. &nbsp;    He is the latest Republican senator to urge the House Ethics Committee to release its findings on Gaetz, who is accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and other House Republicans have called on the Ethics panel to keep its report secret, warning it would set a bad precedent to issue reports on individuals who have already left Congress.    \u201cIt should not come out,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d",

        "content": "In a preliminary vote on Tuesday, Texas education officials approved a proposal to allow lessons about the Bible into public school classrooms, according to multiple news reports. \u00a0    The state Board of Education voted 8-7\u00a0to adopt standards that would teach biblical lessons to students kindergarten through fifth grade, The New York Times reported. \u00a0    Critics have said the material disproportionately focuses on Christianity, only briefly mentioning other religions such as Judaism or Islam. &nbsp;    While schools will not be required to take on the curriculum, they will get an extra $60 per student in funding if they do so. &nbsp;    The final board vote to officially implement the new curriculum will take place on Friday, according to The Texas Tribune. \u00a0    \u201cTexas AFT [American Federation of Teachers] believes that not only do these materials violate the separation of church and state and the academic freedom of our classroom, but also the sanctity of the teaching profession. These prescriptive materials cannot meet all learners in all contexts, and teachers must be empowered to adapt to the needs of their students,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u00a0    The state Board of Education heard testimony from 150 people on Monday for eight hours, both in support and against the new curriculum.\u00a0    \u201cJust reading some of the passages from the Bible will not cause someone to convert, as many Biblical scholars are not themselves Christian,\u201d supporter Glenn Melvin said during the testimony, local outlet WPSD reported.&nbsp;    The new revisions focus on K through 5 reading and English classes and were structured around the state-level Bluebonnet Learning.\u00a0    The Texas Freedom Network, which focuses on religious freedom, released a report saying they do not support the standards.&nbsp;    The group said the problems with the material are \u201csystemic\u2014especially the curriculum\u2019s \u2018Bible-infused\u2019 character and resulting religious imbalance\u2014and require a thorough overhaul rather than piecemeal revision.\"\u00a0    \u201cThe BB version still verges on Christian proselytism insofar as its extensive, lopsided coverage of Christianity and the Bible suggests that this is the only religious tradition of any importance. That is not a message that Texas public schools, which are called to serve a religiously diverse population, have any business conveying,\u201d the report added. &nbsp;    The move has been in development for months and comes after Texas became the first state to allow religious chaplains in schools. \u00a0    Earlier this year, neighboring Oklahoma issued an education mandate ordering that biblical lessons be incorporated into public school curricula. That measure has been challenged in court.",

        "content": "Vice President-elect JD Vance (R-Ohio) revealed the Trump team is interviewing candidates to lead the FBI, a sign of plans to boot current Director Christopher Wray.    Vance\u2019s comments came amid a spat on social platform X as he faced criticism for missing a Senate vote in which a judicial nominee of President Biden was approved.    \u201cWhen this 11th Circuit vote happened, I was meeting with President Trump to interview multiple positions for our government, including for FBI Director,\u201d Vance wrote on X.    \u201cI tend to think it's more important to get an FBI director who will dismantle the deep state than it is for Republicans to lose a vote 49-46 rather than 49-45,\" he added.    Vance later deleted the tweet, in which he called conservative commentator Grace Chong a \"mouth breathing imbecile.\"    Trump has become a vocal critic of the FBI and its leader, who he nominated to the job in 2017.    FBI directors serve 10-year terms, meaning Wray would not ordinarily leave his post until 2027, though the agency head can be removed by the president.    The FBI declined to comment.    Among the names circulating for a possible new director is Kash Patel, a former national security official during the first Trump administration who is also now a board member for Trump\u2019s media company.    Patel would be a controversial pick for the role, a Trump loyalist who sparked internal battles during President-elect Trump's first term and has parroted his views in seeing the FBI as weaponized agency that improperly investigated him.    \u201cThe Deep State can not be trusted. They have weaponized the government for their own political and personal agenda,\u201d Patel wrote in an email last week from his foundation, calling the investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties \u201cfraud.\u201d    Former FBI Special Agent Daniel Brunner said if&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;chooses loyalist and former Trump administration aide&nbsp;Kash Patel&nbsp;to lead the FBI, it would do \u201cmassive damage\u201d to the agency.    \u201cPutting someone like Kash Patel in the position of director of the FBI is, I believe, extremely, extremely dangerous because \u2026 his resume isn\u2019t traditional,\u201d\u00a0Brunner said Sunday.
