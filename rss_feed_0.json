        "content": "Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) gathered privately for a \u201cproductive\u201d meeting last week, a source familiar with the situation and the congresswoman told The Hill, the latest sign of easing tensions between the two.    The huddle \u2014 which took place Wednesday night of last week and ran for more than 30 minutes, according to the source \u2014&nbsp;was described as \u201cproductive\u201d by Greene. She declined to disclose specifics on what they discussed.    It came hours after House GOP lawmakers unanimously nominated Johnson&nbsp;to remain in the top job next year, a significant feat for the Louisiana Republican after facing some resistance within the conference. And it took place as the Jan. 3 Speaker vote on the House floor inches closer, when Johnson will again need near-unanimous support from the conference to win the gavel.    Johnson\u2019s unanimous support last week included backing from Greene, who had emerged as one of the Speaker\u2019s sharpest critics throughout his tenure in the top job \u2014&nbsp;going as far as to lead a motion to vacate against the Louisiana Republican in May, which failed.    Greene, however, has appeared to change her tune this month, as President-elect Trump prepares to control the White House next year and Republicans prepare for full control of Washington.    That new posture was evident last week when Greene \u2014 on the eve of Johnson\u2019s unanimous Speaker nomination \u2014 did not rule out supporting Johnson\u2019s bid&nbsp;to keep the gavel.    \u201cWell, I think he\u2019s the only one running for Speaker, so I don\u2019t understand everybody asking this question,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American people overwhelmingly voted for President Trump\u2019s agenda, not anyone else\u2019s agenda, President Trump\u2019s agenda, MAGA agenda, America First agenda. And I think that\u2019s a mandate from the American people. So, I think whoever\u2019s in charge here in the House, their job is to pass President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d    Pressed by The Hill on those comments \u2014 recognizing that it sounds like she was not ruling out opposing Johnson on the floor despite her past criticism \u2014&nbsp;Greene once again left the door open.    \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been critical of is passing the Biden-Harris agenda in the House that\u2019s funding, fully funding, an agenda that [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer [D-N.Y.] loved so much he passed it right through the Senate, reauthorizing FISA and warrantless spying on Americans and giving $60 billion to Ukraine,\u201d Greene said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think that\u2019ll happen under President Trump. I\u2019m sure he will never allow that, and neither will the American people.\u201d    The openness to supporting Johnson \u2014 and her description of a \u201cproductive meeting\u201d last week \u2014 mark a sharp change in the pair\u2019s relationship, which has been marked by bitter tension.    Greene\u2019s opposition to Johnson reached a fever pitch in May, when the Georgia Republican brought a motion to vacate against the Speaker, which failed amid opposition from lawmakers in both parties. Only 11 Republicans voted against tabling the measure. Greene had been critical of Johnson for helping move a roughly $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, and supporting the reauthorization of warrantless spying powers.",

        "content": "Senate Democrats are expected to vote late into the night Monday in a frantic effort to confirm as many of President Biden\u2019s nominees to the federal judiciary as possible before President-elect Trump takes over in January.    Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told colleagues on the Senate floor Monday that the Democratic majority \u201cwill keep working to confirm as many of President Biden\u2019s judicial nominees as we can before the end of the year.\u201d    That means Senate votes stretching late into the night and possibly working over weekends and even during the Christmas recess in late December.    Senators were expecting to hold a series of procedural votes late into Monday night or early Tuesday morning to allow Schumer to file cloture on a batch of Biden nominees, which would set up confirmation votes for later in the week.    Republicans were dragging out the process Monday night by forcing Democrats to hold time-consuming votes on procedural motions to switch from executive to legislative session and back again.    Usually shuttling in between legislative and executive session is a routine move that the minority party agrees to by unanimous consent, without forcing colleagues to show up on the Senate floor to vote for an arcane motion.    Senate staff warned that senators could hold as many as 18 votes Monday night to conduct the procedural business that is often handled with a simple request for unanimous consent.    Schumer asked for unanimous consent at 7:32 pm to limit the length of the procedural votes to 10 minutes.    Republicans confirmed 234 of Trump\u2019s nominees to the federal courts during his four years in office, and so far the Democrat-controlled Senate has confirmed only 216 of Biden\u2019s Article III judicial nominees \u2014 at least, as of Monday afternoon.    Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that holding votes over the weekend and even during parts of the Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks is a possibility.    \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule those out and Schumer has not ruled them out either,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI hope that the Republicans will at least be as cooperative with us as we were with them.\u201d    Leading progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) urged Schumer in a Time magazine op-ed to \u201cuse every minute of the end-of-the year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators \u2014 none of whom can be removed by the next president.\"    The Senate voted at 5:30 p.m. Monday to confirm Embry Kidd of Florida to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.    Senators were facing 18 more procedural votes Monday evening to set up cloture votes later in the week on nine more nominees.",

        "content": "The House on Monday passed a massive bill that will fund a range of veterans care services and increase opportunities for retired service members in the workforce and education.    The Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act, known as the Dole Act, passed on a bipartisan 389-9 vote.    The bill is a win for Republicans who have pointed to issues with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and have called to allow veterans to access more care at home.    Rep. Mike Bost (R-Ill.), chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said a big provision is that the VA will no longer \"get to decide where veterans should get their health care.\"    \"The Dole Act would rightfully make sure that a VA bureaucracy cannot veto a doctor's medical decisions,\" he said on the House floor before the vote. \"Two weeks ago, the American people voted us a mandate to fix problems they talked about at their kitchen tables that affect their families and communities every single day. The Dole Act is a foundation for that work to begin with the veterans community.\"    Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) said it was important to \"ensure that no veteran will have to worry about losing his VA benefits for their family when choosing to spend their last days in the comfort of their home.\"    The bill will next head to the Senate, but it's unclear if there is support for the legislation in the Democratic-controlled chamber.    Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, said the Dole Act will \"connect veterans caregivers to respite care and other support services that help them care for veterans at home,\" calling it \"an investment in care for millions of veterans and current service members.\"    But he also said it was an \"uphill battle\" to get the bill passed, accusing the GOP of \"outsourcing more VA care to for profit health care providers\" in the original bill before a compromise was reached in the past week to preserve VA services.    \"We want VA to remain a strong provider of care, instead of diminishing it to nothing more than an insurance company where profits are prioritized over outcomes for veterans,\" Takano said, adding he supported the bill but was upset about a few provisions.    The Dole Act, named for the former Republican senator from North Carolina, is a major priority for veterans advocacy groups who point to the bill's wide range of funding priorities to improve care through the VA.    The legislation would tackle vexing problems for veterans like housing, offering Native American veterans home projects and purchases on tribal land and authorizing the VA to provide grants for transitional housing for all veterans.    It also bolsters mental health care for veterans, increases coverage for veterans seeking alternatives to nursing home care, funds at-home services, covers ambulance rides to the VA and provides more options for veterans who need a caretaker, among a long list of other health services.    And the bill includes efforts to increase education through expanding scholarship access and modernizing educational assistance tools.     Elizabeth Dole Foundation CEO Steve Schwab said his organization has been working \"for more than a year to pass this transformative legislation for the millions of veterans, caregivers, survivors, and families we serve.\"    Schwab said in a statement he \"will push for swift passage in the Senate to follow so that we can get this to the President\u2019s desk to sign. Our veterans, caregivers, and survivors are depending on us to get this over the finish line.\"    Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) also supported the Dole Act this month.    \"This IS a good piece of bipartisan-negotiated legislation that had input from numerous organizations representing veterans, caregivers, and survivors from around the country,\" VFW wrote in a statement.",

Wild, who is leaving Congress at the end of the year after being defeated by Republican challenger Ryan Mackenzie, said that she expected all Democrats to vote in favor of releasing the report. On the evenly split panel with five Republicans and five Democrats, it would take at least one Republican to side with Democrats to vote to release the report.    \u201cEverybody on the committee now has the report, so they've got the opportunity to be reviewing it,\u201d Wild said.    Asked about the possibility of releasing the report only to the Senate, Wild said: \u201cEither you are going to disclose it or you're not going to disclose it.\u201d    Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the Ethics Committee, declined to confirm details about the meeting scheduled for Wednesday.    Guest did say that he has read the report on Gaetz, and that other members on the panel \u201chave the ability to read the report.\u201d He declined to offer his thoughts on what the Gaetz report said.    The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing.    Gaetz abruptly resigned from his seat the same day he was announced as Trump's attorney general pick. A source told The Hill that his resignation came just two days before the committee was scheduled to meet to vote to release the report, but that meeting was later canceled.    Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has publicly advocated against releasing the report, since Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress and the committee traditionally does not investigate former members.    \u201cI think that would be a Pandora's box. I don't think we want the House Ethics Committee using all of its vast resources and powers to go after private citizens,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d    While such a move is very rare, there is precedent for the committee releasing a report after a member resigned. In 1987, the committee released its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House.    Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they want to see the report.",

He has historically been a supporter of the president-elect, defending Trump\u2019s controversial 2017 executive order on immigration imposing a 90-day ban on nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries from coming into the U.S.    \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a pause? We\u2019ve having a pause for 90 days. Why is that so radical?\u201d Duffy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d at the time.    In his Monday statement, Trump said Duffy \u201cwas a respected voice and communicator in the Republican Conference, advocating for Fiscal Responsibility, Economic Growth, and Rural Development\u201d while \u201cin Congress.\u201d    Trump also urged Duffy to run for Wisconsin governor in 2022, saying he was trying \u201chard to get very popular and capable Former Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin to run for Governor\u201d in late 2021.    Duffy said later in early 2022 that he would not run for the Badger State\u2019s top office.    \u201cHopefully I\u2019m not riding off into the sunset,\u201d Duffy said on 1130 WISN, a talk radio station. \u201cI\u2019m just running into the sunset right now.

        "content": "Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) on Monday introduced a bill to bar transgender women from facilities on Capitol Hill that match their gender identity.    The resolution, which would prohibit members, officers and employees of the House from using single-sex facilities that correspond to their gender identity, comes just a week after Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.)\u00a0made history\u00a0as the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.    The measure charges the House sergeant-at-arms, William McFarland, with enforcing the ban, according to text previewed by The Hill, but it is unclear how the House\u2019s chief law enforcement officer will determine who can and cannot use the Capitol\u2019s facilities.    State laws that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity often rely on anonymous complaints, a notoriously unreliable enforcement mechanism. LGBTQ rights activists in May\u00a0flooded a tip line\u00a0designed to alert officials in Utah to possible violations of the state\u2019s bathroom ban with thousands of false complaints.    \"This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,\" McBride said in a statement. \"We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"    \"Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible and that's what I'm focused on,\" she said.    Mace is currently in talks with leadership regarding how to bring the measure to the floor, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill.    The congresswoman initially planned to call her legislation to the floor as a privileged resolution on Monday evening, the source said, a gambit that would have forced leadership to stage a vote on the measure within two legislative days.    But Mace scrapped those plans because of ongoing negotiations with leadership regarding the best way to pass the legislation, the source said. Mace is pushing for the measure to be included in the rules package for the 119th Congress, or for it to be brought to the floor and voted on as a stand-alone rule outside the package.    If the bill, however, is not included in the 119th Congress rules package or brought to the floor as a stand-alone rule, Mace would force a vote on the legislation, the source said.    The House is set to vote on a rules package for the next Congress in early January, which will require a majority vote for passage. Republicans are poised to have a razor-thin majority when the next session gavels in.    Updated at 7:13 pm EST.",

Fifty percent of employees say they are thriving, while 45 percent say they are struggling. An additional 4 percent say they are suffering. After a steady decline since 2020, this 2024 number marks a record low thriving rate since Gallup created the index in 2009. &nbsp;    The Gallup Life Evaluation Index measures how people rate their current and expected future lives. Respondents who respond \"thriving\" have positive views of their current and immediate futures. They report significantly fewer health problems, fewer negative emotions like worry and stress, and more positive emotions like happiness and energy.&nbsp;    Similarly, 51 percent of respondents said they experience stress \"a lot\" during the day, up from 49 percent in 2023. Eighteen percent of respondents said the same about anger.      Gallup also found that workers who are not thriving in their life experience higher amounts of worry, anger and employee burnout. Twenty-eight percent of U.S. employees already said they \"very often or always\" feel burned out at work.    Engaged employees who are not \u201cthriving\u201d are 61 percent more likely to experience burnout often or always and have double the rates of sadness and anger. Meanwhile, thriving employees miss 53 percent fewer days due to health issues. An August Gallup poll also revealed that only 37 percent of employees feel respected at work, down from 39 percent in May.     The Gallup poll, conducted Aug. 11-25, included 10,570 full-time workers and had a margin of error of 1.2 percentage points.",

After a whirlwind hearing earlier this year, the trial judge ruled the case could move forward and that Willis could continue to oversee the prosecution so long as Wade resigned, which he did.&nbsp;    The appeals court was slated to hear arguments from Trump and eight of his co-defendants that Willis cannot oversee the prosecution.    Willis indicted the former president and more than a dozen of his allies on racketeering and other charges for allegedly entering a months-long, unlawful conspiracy to overturn Trump\u2019s 2020 loss in Georgia, one of four criminal cases brought against the former president.    Trump\u2019s legal team believes all his criminal prosecutions must be dismantled now that he is president-elect, but his attorneys hadn\u2019t yet formally mounted such an effort in the Georgia case.&nbsp;    The appeals court could still issue its ruling without hearing arguments, but before the election, it agreed to hold them at Trump\u2019s request.&nbsp;    The Hill has reached out to Willis\u2019s office and Trump\u2019s attorney for comment.&nbsp;    Monday\u2019s cancellation is the last of Trump\u2019s four criminal cases to be halted following his White House victory.&nbsp;    Courts have put on hold special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s federal election interference case in the nation\u2019s capital and his appeal in the documents case in Florida. Smith is assessing how to wind down the prosecutions before Trump's inauguration and is due to provide an update by Dec. 2.    In New York, Trump\u2019s judge overseeing his hush money criminal case has temporarily frozen it until Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) proposes next steps by Tuesday. Legal observers largely expect next week\u2019s sentencing to be cancelled.&nbsp;",

The search has since expanded. Trump is also considering Apollo Global Management co-founder Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh for the job, a source close to the transition confirmed to The Hill. Whoever the president-elect picks will be tasked with implementing key campaign promises including extending tax cuts set to expire next year and imposing tariffs on imports, a central to Trump's economic pitch to voters despite concerns from economists. \u201cAll these guys will be OK with tax cuts and reassuring the markets,\u201d said one source close to the transition. \u201cBut he wants somebody that is a true believer in what he thinks on tariffs, and\u2026there\u2019s no proof for these people being pro-tariff 18 months ago or 36 months ago.\u201d The Treasury secretary contest had largely played out behind closed doors until this weekend, when Musk posted on X that Bessent would be a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d choice. &nbsp; \u201cBusiness-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another,\u201d Musk wrote, encouraging others to weigh in with their opinions.

Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the House Ethics Committee, said that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) won\u2019t influence whether his committee releases its report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who vacated his House seat last week after being tapped to become President-elect Trump's attorney general.    Johnson has urged the Ethics Committee against releasing the Gaetz report, saying it would be \u201ca terrible breach of protocol and tradition and the spirit of the rule,\u201d since Gaetz is no longer a House member.     Guest said Monday that he and Johnson spoke at the end of last week, according to Politico.    \u201cI appreciate Mike reaching out,\u201d Guest told the outlet. \u201cI don't see it having an impact on what we as a committee ultimately decide.\u201d    While Trump has nominated a number of controversial figures to his Cabinet, none has garnered more blowback than Gaetz, a far-right firebrand and fierce Trump loyalist.     At the Department of Justice, he would take over an agency that previously investigated him over allegations of sex trafficking. Though that probe did not lead to charges, the House Ethics Committee opened its own investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz has denied allegations of wrongdoing.    Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that Gaetz paid them to have sex, according to the attorney representing them.    Democrats and some Republicans have said the findings in the report must be released to senators weighing his nomination.     The Ethics Committee pushed back a meeting last week about the report, and is now set to meet Wednesday about it, a source told The Hill. Guest told Politico the report is not available to all members of the committee.    Johnson has quickly found his way into Trump's inner orbit following this month's election victory, and is trying to exert his influence to block the Gaetz report.     \u201cI\u2019m going to strongly request the Ethics Committee not issue the report, because that is not how we do things in the House and I think that would be a terrible precedent to set,\u201d he told reporters on Friday.    In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, Johnson said he had not spoken with Trump about the report.    \u201cThe president and I have literally not discussed one word about the ethics report, not once, and I\u2019ve been with him quite a bit this week \u2014 between Washington and Mar-a-Lago and last night at Madison Square Garden,\u201d Johnson said.

        "content": "A bipartisan coalition of more than 30 attorney generals is urging Congress to pass the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) this year, stating the legislation will \u201cestablish better safeguards for minors online.\u201d &nbsp;    In a letter sent to leadership offices in the House and Senate, the 32 attorneys general said they are concerned about the negative impacts \u201cprolific internet usage\u201d has on children. \u00a0    \u201cWe are acutely aware of the threats minors face on social media. Many social media platforms target minors, resulting in a national youth mental health catastrophe,\u201d the letter, led by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti (R), stated. &nbsp;    \u201cThese platforms make their products addictive to minor users, and then profit from selling minor user data to advertisers,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cThese platforms fail to disclose the addicting nature of their products, nor the harms associated with increased social media use. Instead, minor users receive endless tailored and toxic content.\u201d&nbsp;    The letter comes as KOSA faces an uncertain future in the House, where leadership has expressed concerns the bill would censor conservative voices or overstep authority. &nbsp;    KOSA, which passed the Senate in a 91-3 vote last summer, is intended to boost online privacy and safety for children. It would create regulations for the kinds of features tech and social media companies offer kids online and aims to reduce the addictive nature and mental health impact of these platforms. &nbsp;    To make their case for KOSA, the attorneys general pointed to the investigations and lawsuits led by many of their offices against Meta and TikTok for alleged harm to minors. &nbsp;    More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit against TikTok last month, alleging the platform exploits and harms young users and \u201cdeceives\u201d the public about these dangers. &nbsp;    Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is similarly facing state-led suits accusing the tech giant of knowingly designing and deploying harmful features on its platforms. &nbsp;    The attorneys general said congressional passage of KOSA will aid state-level efforts by mandating social media platforms have the strongest safety settings by default and allowing kids and their parents or guardians to opt out of the \u201cmost addictive product features\u201d and algorithmic recommendations. &nbsp;    The bill would also give parents new controls to \u201csupport their children and identify harmful behaviors,\u201d and improve their reporting abilities, the state leaders noted.&nbsp;    \u201cThis is a great improvement over the earlier version that did not provide for state enforcement. The states have been consistently acting to vigorously protect kids from online dangers using their existing consumer protection authority, and we look forward to further collaboration,\u201d the letter wrote. &nbsp;    New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), one of the signatories, emphasized KOSA will help states introduce more safeguards when necessary. &nbsp;    \u201cWith KOSA, we can establish a foundation of protections for kids nationwide, but we must also ensure states are empowered to introduce more expansive safeguards for their kids as needed,\u201d she said in a release Monday. \u201cTaking on addictive social media is not a partisan issue \u2013 it\u2019s about protecting kids and ensuring that government is able to act effectively at all levels.\u201d&nbsp;    James helped push a state bill to limit \"addictive\" social media feeds for kids past the finish line last summer, and is overseeing the rulemaking process for the law to take effect.    While&nbsp;the bill advanced out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee last month, there are only weeks remaining in the lame-duck session and members in both parties have expressed issues with its language, for varied reasons. &nbsp;    House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told Punchbowl News&nbsp; last month he likes the concept of KOSA, though the details of the Senate-passed version are \u201cvery problematic.\u201d &nbsp;    Meanwhile, some lawmakers were concerned with the language of KOSA\u2019s \u201cduty of care\u201d provision. As written in the Senate version, the provision would require platforms to design and implement features for minors to prevent and reduce harm, such as those caused by content promoting suicide and eating disorders.&nbsp;    The House version that advanced out of committee last month included amendments changing this provision.&nbsp;",
